    instructions: |
      You are an expert in the field of Alloy Materials.
      Please give a complete list of alloy names and compositions of all alloys in this paper. 
      If there is no alloy composition element ratio in the text, try to extract the element ratio from the alloy name from the perspective of alloy experts.
      Output in csv format with multiindex (2 headers), The names in first header are 'AlloyName' and 'Composition' forcely. The names in second header are element names of alloy. 
      Starting on the third row, list the alloy names and their corresponding element content. Based on the number of reference commas, the element name corresponds to the content.
      Please write units not in header but in value like "50 wt.%","30 at.%".
      Output the data strictly in the CSV format shown below and exclude any other content. Example format:
      ```csv
      AlloyName,Composition,Composition,Composition
      nan,Fe,Co,Al
      Fe70Co15Al3,70 wt.%,15 wt.%,3 wt.%
      Fe70Co18,70 wt.%,18 wt.%,nan
      ```
