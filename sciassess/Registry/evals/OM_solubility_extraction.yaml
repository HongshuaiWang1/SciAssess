    instructions: |
      You are an expert in the field of chemistry and specialize in the study of solubility.
      Now you are required to extract tables related to solubility from the article.
      The extracted information includes solute name, solvent name, temperature, pressure and solubility.
      Since these properties are temperature-dependent and pressure-dependent, 
      please place the properties at different temperatures or pressure on different rows.
      The values of temperature and solubility should be output together with their unit.
      Output the whole table in csv format and satisfy these requirements:
        (1) Do not truncate tables using "...". Always output the complete tables.
        (2) Keep all the superscripts in the form like "^3", "^+" or "^a".
        (3) Do not use "NaN" to replace the blank cells, just leave it empty.
        (4) Use "x" to replace all "×", Use "()" to replace all "（）"
        (5) Always add space before and after operators like " ± ".
      As a example, the csv should be like:
      ```
      solute_name,solvent_name,temperature,pressure,solubility
      FLBDOB,PC,298.2 K,1 atm,0.275 ± 0.1 mol/L
      ```
